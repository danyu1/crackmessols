break point notable addresses with strings
--> 0040133A, 00401346, 00401359

[listing]
run up until scanf call *might need to set a breakpoint at the instruction*

before you enter a password set a break point at 00401365 to analyze the cmp call

enter a password

notice: *
cmp: This is the mnemonic for the "compare" instruction, which is used to compare two values.
dword ptr: This specifies the size of the operands being compared. In this case, it indicates that a double word (32 bits) is being compared.

ss:[ebp-4]: This is the memory operand. It refers to the value stored at the address [ebp-4] relative to the stack segment (ss). The ebp register
 typically points to the base of the current stack frame, and in this case, we are accessing the value stored at an offset of 4 bytes below ebp.

149A: This is the immediate value, the constant being compared against the value at [ebp-4]. In this case, 149A represents a hexadecimal value.

due to this it's possible to deduce that either the register at [ebp-4] or 149A the next step will require you to analyze and follow each register to their respectice caches
*

follow [ebp-4] to the dump to find its address and its binary value

convert the hex value into deci and you should find the password that you entered

notice: *
due to this you now know that the edp-4 register holds your password and that the real password is 149A 
*

convert 149A into dec and find that the password is 5274
